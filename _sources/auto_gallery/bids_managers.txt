BIDS directory parsing
======================

Credit: A Grigis

pycaravel is a Python package that enables you to parse various source of data.
In this tutorial you will learn how to parse and search a BIDS directory, and
then create a representation of this parser. Using the described representation
will speed up the search for users.

First checks
------------

In order to test if pycaravel package is installed on your machine, you can
check the package version.



.. code-block:: python


    import caravel

    print(caravel.__version__)


Now you can run the the configuration info function to see if all the
dependencies are installed properly:



.. code-block:: python


    print(caravel.info())


Create a parser for your project
--------------------------------

The package provides a common interface to parse a BIDS directory. The
parsing rules are defined by projects in the module, so we will beed to
specify the project name you are working on. For the moment it is not
possible to specify these rules via the API. Set the layoutdir to None
in order to switch to the managers mode.



.. code-block:: python


    parser = caravel.Caravel(project="hbn", layoutdir=None)


Create representation of your BIDS directory
--------------------------------------------

You will now parse your BIDS directory. As this step may be time consuming,
the managers are in charge of creating a representation of the final
parser that will be used during the user search steps. This can be done by
using the following function, specifying the BIDS root directory and
the subfolder name to be parsed (sourcedata, derivatives, phenotype, ...).
This name must have a conresponding configuration file.



.. code-block:: python


    parser.pickling_layout(
        bids_root="/neurospin/tmp/pycaravel/hbn",
        name="sourcedata",
        outdir="/neurospin/tmp/pycaravel/layout")
    print(parser.list_keys("sourcedata"))
